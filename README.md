## üìå Overview

This collection of notebooks demonstrates the use of computational techniques to address statistical problems. Topics include **Monte Carlo methods**, the **Acceptance-Rejection technique**, **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**, resampling strategies like **bootstrap** and **jackknife**, and more. The work showcases how code-based experimentation complements and deepens theoretical understanding.

## üìÅ Assignment Summaries

**HW2**  
Focused on hypothesis testing and simulating random processes to assess statistical properties. Included estimation of the **Gini index** for Uniform and Bernoulli distributions, offering insight into how inequality metrics behave under different sampling conditions.

**HW3**  
Explored the **Inverse Transformation Method** for simulating data from custom probability distributions, including Uniform, Pareto, and discrete types. Compared theoretical and empirical distributions, highlighting the strengths and limitations of this approach.

**HW4**  
Applied the **Acceptance-Rejection method** to sample from complex shapes (circles, spheres) and non-standard distributions. Also included a creative simulation on **student seating randomness** in a trapezoidal classroom setup.

**HW5**  
Introduced **Monte Carlo Integration** and **Importance Sampling**. Assignments included estimating integrals using uniform and exponential proposals and comparing variances to assess sampling efficiency.

**HW6**  
Dived into **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**, focusing on **Gibbs sampling** and the **Metropolis-Hastings algorithm**. Included implementation of a random scan Gibbs sampler and simulations for grid-based models to estimate interaction-based probabilities.

**HW7**  
Covered **resampling methods** (bootstrap and jackknife) and the **Expectation-Maximization (EM)** algorithm. Tasks ranged from bias estimation in sample correlations to **PCA variance interpretation** and probability estimation with **incomplete data**.

**Midterm Project**  
Consolidated course concepts in a practical exam setting. Topics included convergence under the **Law of Large Numbers**, **Monte Carlo simulations**, and **variance estimation**. Emphasis was placed on visualizing outcomes and validating theoretical expectations through code.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

To run these notebooks, you'll need:

- **R + Jupyter**: Make sure R is installed and integrated with Jupyter Notebooks.  
- **R Packages**: Some assignments require packages like `bootstrap`, `MASS`, and others.  
- **Background Knowledge**: A foundation in statistical theory and computational techniques will help you navigate the content effectively.
